Here is a password generator using JavaScript.

Assignment Code lists generate button and characters that are randomly chosen based on criteria you selected and character checks

determineLength function is based upon how many characters you would want in password between 8-128 characters long. After you select length, you will be prompted to select type of characters you want in your password. If you select "N/No" for all prompts, password will only contain lowercase letters

determineUppercase function asks whether you want uppercase letters in your password

determineNumbers function asks whether you want numbers in your password

determineSpecial function asks whether you want special characters in your password

generatePassword function tallies your responses from previous prompts and generates a password using a random number generator & charAt method which returns specified character from a string

writePassword function writes password on input screen

any questions/comments your feedback is appreciated

P.S. wanted to add a Copy function so when you clicked on Copy Button, it would copy to clipboard, but could not get it to work so scrapped function.
